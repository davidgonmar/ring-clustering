abstract = {The Fuzzy c-Shells (FCS) algorithm and its adaptive generalization, called the Adaptive Fuzzy c-Shells (AFCS) algorithm, are considered for detection of curved boundaries, specifically circular and elliptical. The FCS algorithms utilize hyper-spherical-shells as cluster prototypes. Thus in two dimensions, the prototypes are circles. The AFCS algorithms consider hyper-ellipsoidal-shells as prototypes, hence the ability to characterize elliptical boundaries. The generalization is achieved by allowing the distances to be measured through a norm inducing matrix that is symmetric, positive definite. Each cluster is allowed to have a different matrix, which is made a variable of optimization. The ability of the algorithms to detect circular and elliptical boundaries in two-dimensional data is illustrated through several examples.}

abstract = {This paper transmits a FORTRAN-IV coding of the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering program. The FCM program is applicable to a wide variety of geostatistical data analysis problems. This program generates fuzzy partitions and prototypes for any set of numerical data. These partitions are useful for corroborating known substructures or suggesting substructure in unexplored data. The clustering criterion used to aggregate subsets is a generalized least-squares objective function. Features of this program include a choice of three norms (Euclidean, Diagonal, or Mahalonobis), an adjustable weighting factor that essentially controls sensitivity to noise, acceptance of variable numbers of clusters, and outputs that include several measures of cluster validity.}

abstract = {Clustering is a process to classify data into some clusters or classes so then data in same cluster have maximum similarity and data between clusters have minimum similarity. Generally, clustering is separated into two methods, hierarchical and non-hierarchical methods. Non-hierarchical methods are separated as soft clustering and hard clustering. Non-Hierarchical methods that mostly used is K-Means algorithm. K-Means grouping object into certain member and not included in different clusters. Another approaches in clustering technique which is based on fuzzy sets theory is known as fuzzy clustering. Fuzzy clustering is one kind of soft clustering that also widely used because of many advantages than the hard clustering. Several varieties of fuzzy clustering are Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and Fuzzy C-Shells (FCS). FCM is characterized by centre of cluster and FCS uses radius as additional parameter. This paper concerns FCS clustering algorithm using review of several references. Hence, FCS is characterized by centre of cluster and radius.}
